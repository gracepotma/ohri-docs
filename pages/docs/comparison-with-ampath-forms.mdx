# Supported AMPATH Forms Features

O3 Forms has committed to the schema used by the AMPATH Forms Builder, and as such, there is a high level of compatibility. O3 Forms will be able to use the entire schema, but some features may not yet have been implemented by O3 Forms. Some may be added in the future, other functionality may not be considered necessary for O3 Forms. This page summarises that. In general we are tracking the work to achieve required feature parity [here in the OpenMRS community Jira](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/O3-1903).
